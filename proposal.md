abstract: "With the dawn of the internet of things, a major spotlight has been placed on insecure networked systems and services. In this paper, we perform a survey of Massachusetts colleges to see how many of them use technologies that are discoverable on the open web, and how many of them use technologies that are regarded as insecure."

## 1. Social Implications
In this paper, we hope to answer a single question: Are liberal arts colleges, which grow thought-leaders and philosophers, doing as much work as technical and engineering colleges in order to protect their institutional networks? Our initial hypothesis is no, since they are generally less technoloy-oriented and thus have less of a focus on protecting their networks.

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Vulnerability Analysis
We will be leveraging a combination of Shodan (https://www.shodan.io) and Censys (https://www.censys.io) to gather information on colleges in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Both of these web services provide access to data on thousands of internet connected devices and servers, enabling us to measure two things:

1. Which colleges and universities have internet-facing systems.
2. Which internet-facing systems are associated with vulnerabilities and attacks.

We will leverage various cyber attack threat maps to understand which systems are most vulnerable or most commonly attacked. Courtesy of CSO Online (https://www.csoonline.com/article/3217944/security/8-top-cyber-attack-maps-and-how-to-use-them.html) is a list of potential services we may leverage (ordered in terms of appeal to our team):

2. https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/ThreatPortal/livemap.html

### 2.2 Institution Analysis
We will limit our analysis to a limited number of educational institutions and/or geographic locations; this limit will be determined during our analysis.

If time allows, we ***may*** review the websites of identified institutions and data from the National Center for Education and Statistics (https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/) to determine if institutions are either ***liberal-arts focused*** (Category 1) or ***engineering-focused*** (Category 2); a college will fall into Category 1 if 50% of its students are engaged in non-technical majors, and Category 2 if 50% or more of its graduates are technical majors.
